.TH GOL 1 gol\-VERSION
.SH NAME
gol \- Conway's Game of Life TUI simulator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gol
.RB [ \fIdensity\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gol
is a simple, fast, and terminal\-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
It uses the ncurses library to display the cellular automaton grid and runs the
simulation logic in an infinite loop until explicitly quit.
.P
The program displays the grid of cells, the current generation count, and the
simulation state (RUNNING or PAUSED) in a status bar at the bottom of the terminal.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIdensity\fR
An optional argument that sets the initial density of live cells in the grid.
The density value must be an integer between 1 (calm) and 1000 (chaotic).
.SH USAGE
While the program is running, input is non\-blocking (you do not need to press
ENTER). The following keys are recognized for control:
.SS Keyboard Commands
.TP
.B q
Immediately exits the application and restores the terminal.
.TP
.B space
Toggles the simulation state between RUNNING and PAUSED.
.TP
.B s
Advances the simulation by exactly one generation. This command is only effective
when the simulation is in the PAUSED state.
