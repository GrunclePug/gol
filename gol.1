.TH GOL 1 gol\-VERSION
.SH NAME
gol \- Dynamic Cellular Automata TUI simulator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gol
.RB [ \fIdensity\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gol
is a fast, terminal\-based **Cellular Automata (CA)** simulator that dynamically cycles
between two configured rule sets: Growth (\fBB36/S236\fR by default) and Decay
(\fBB3/S23\fR by default).
.P
The program monitors the live cell density and automatically switches rule sets
when the density passes configurable high or low thresholds (MIN\_THRESHOLD and
MAX\_THRESHOLD in \fBconfig.h\fR), ensuring the simulation remains active.
.P
It uses the ncurses library to display the cellular automaton grid and runs the
simulation logic in an infinite loop until explicitly quit.
.P
The program displays the grid of cells, the current rule set, the density
percentage, and the simulation state (RUNNING or PAUSED) in a status bar at the
bottom of the terminal.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIdensity\fR
An optional argument that sets the initial random seeding chance of live cells in the grid.
The value is an integer between **1 (low density)** and **1000 (high density)**.
The default value is 2.
.SH USAGE
While the program is running, input is non\-blocking (you do not need to press
ENTER). The following keys are recognized for control:
.SS Keyboard Commands
.TP
.B q
Immediately exits the application and restores the terminal.
.TP
.B space
Toggles the simulation state between RUNNING and PAUSED.
.TP
.B s
Advances the simulation by exactly one generation. This command is only effective
when the simulation is in the PAUSED state.
